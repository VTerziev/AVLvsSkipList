Implementation of a AVL tree and a Skip-List and comparing their performance for different scenarios.

# Running the performance tests: 
generate_scenario- generates the tests scenarios, on which the performance of the two data structures will be evaluated
run_scenario- runs the two structures against the generated test scenarios
